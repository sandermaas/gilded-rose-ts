# Gilded Rose

This is the Gilded Rose kata in TypeScript.

## Considerations while refactoring

- The "Aged Brie" actually increases in quality double as fast when the sellIn value reaches 0. There is no mention of the exact behaviour of "Aged Brie" in the requirements so I will assume this is correct.

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Run the unit tests from the Command-Line

```sh
pnpm test
```

To run the Text test

```sh
pnpm test:text
```

To run all tests in watch mode

```sh
pnpm test:watch
```

## Format the code with Prettier

```sh
pnpm format
```
